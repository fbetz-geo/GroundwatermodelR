<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

GroundwatermodelR is a collection of functions to work with
spatial-temporal interpolation of groundwater levels or similar data.
For creating interpolation models, it relies on the machine learning
workaround presented in the [CAST
package](https://hannameyer.github.io/CAST/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of GroundwatermodelR unsing the
following two lines of code:

``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("fbetz-geo/GroundwatermodelR")
```
