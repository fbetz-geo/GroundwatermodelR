# GroundwatermodelR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

GroundwatermodelR is a collection of functions to work with spatial-temporal interpolation of groundwater levels or similar data. For creating interpolation models, it relies on the machine learning workaround presented in the [CAST package](https://hannameyer.github.io/CAST/). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of GroundwatermodelR unsing the following two lines of code:

``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("fbetz-geo/GroundwatermodelR")
```

## Tutorials
Tutorials are currently under development and will be available [here](https://fbetz-geo.github.com//GroundwatermodelR).
